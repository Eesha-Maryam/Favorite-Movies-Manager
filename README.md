Favorite Movies Manager
The Favorite Movies Manager is a simple web application created using JavaScript that allows users to manage their list of favorite movies dynamically. With this application, users can add their favorite movies to a list by typing the movie name into a text field and clicking the "Add" button. Additionally, users can remove specific movies from the list by clicking the delete button next to each movie entry.

This project showcases the power of JavaScript's DOM manipulation capabilities, demonstrating how events can be utilized to dynamically add and remove elements from the webpage without the need for server-side database storage. Please note that any changes made to the list of favorite movies are temporary and will revert to the original data upon refreshing the webpage.
